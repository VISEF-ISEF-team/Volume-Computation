# Volume Computation of 3D Reconstructed Models from Volumetric Data Using Binary Indexed Tree

In the burgeoning field of medical imaging, precise computation of 3D volume holds a significant importance for subsequent qualitative analysis of 3D reconstructed objects. Combining multivariable calculus, marching cubes algorithm, and binary indexed tree data structure, we develop a algorithm for efficient computation of intrinsic volume of any volumetric data retrieved from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR). We proposed the 30 configurations of volume values based on polygonal mesh generation method. Our algorithm processes the data in scan-line order simultaneously with reconstruction algorithm to create a Fenwick tree,  ensuring query time much faster and assisting users edition of slicing or transforming model. We tested the algorithm's accuracy on simple 3D objects (e.g.sphere, cylinder) to complicated structures (e.g lungs, cardiac chambers). The result deviated within $\pm 0.004 \text{cm}^3$ and there is still space for further improvement.
